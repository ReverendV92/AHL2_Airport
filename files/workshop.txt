[h1][b][i]BACKSTORY[/i][/b][/h1]

Map was original made for the Distraction Half-life 2 mod back all those years ago.
I got to talking to Milk one day and he asked me if I wanted to convert over his distraction
maps to AHL2.  I said sure and he sent me over the .vmf's.  Changes include new textures, 
lighting, and sounds.  Hope you enjoy this map and the mod!!
